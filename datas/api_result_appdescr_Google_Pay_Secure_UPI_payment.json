        "Best And Superfast App...But, not working properly from the last month. I can scan any barcode and make the payment through it. But, when opt for mobile transfer to any person, my keyboard does not pop up. Not at all. Please help, as I tried everything. I cleared its data, cache, and even unistalled & reinstalled the app. But, all in vain. I have not been able to understand the problem even after looking for it on google & Youtube.\ud83d\ude03",
        "Hi, After the last update, I'm not able to open the app. When I click on the login id, the UI disappear's and close the application. Kindly fix the issue ASAP. Secondly, the experience was excellent and swift before, but the cash back is very low. Everyone needs cash backs instead of irrelevant vouchers and coupons. Kindly bring these fixes ASAP. Keep growing guys. Thank you google pay.!!",
        "I keep giving the correct pin, but it says incorrect pin, and locks me out of opening the app. Even when I carefully input each digit. It is really frustrating not being able to open the app. And not like I have already tried multiple wrong tries, it just starts doing this on a whim. Extremely unreliable.",
        "Very impressive! Although there is a problem with the application, the transaction are excellent. My phone keeps making notification noises even after I disable them. It's annoying that I get too many alerts in one day. I ask that someone on the development team take care of this issue. Positively, I like the app's user interface, ease of use, and top-notch customer support. Queries are answered quickly, and the crew provides solutions right away. The app is well-structured, easy to use.",
        "This app is are great, although there hasn't been a single font update over the years, but for older phone versions, clean and just so smooth it does the job quite well. but having to watch two 30 seconds ads every single time you want to use it for free for a single day, is just pure dumb. we should get at le ast 2-3 fronts for free and have an option to watch ads if we need more, it makes it so much easier that way. also, some ads are unquitable, i cannot quit many of those ads never.",
        "Better than other apps. I can't use the app with the current changes. Previous Review Very good banking software that does it everything. I adore this application. If the PPF account can also be examined, it would be fantastic. The user interface is quite intuitive, and the application is light and quick. I've watched this software develop from a basic version with limited features to the robust version it is today. far superior to its rival banking apps.",
        "Google payis my go-to UPI app for all my digital transactions. It's incredibly user-friendly, allowing me to send and receive money effortlessly. The interface is intuitive, making navigation a breeze. What I appreciate most is its reliability; transactions are swift and secure. Plus, the app offers a range of services like bill payments and recharge options, making it a one-stop solution for all my financial needs. Highly recommended! Love you phone pay",
        "It has been over three years since the Flutter-based version was released, yet the app still feels very sluggish and jittery even on a flagship phone, especially during scrolling. However, I really like the fact it stores transaction history indefinitely, and doesn't hide the VPA of online merchants in transaction history, which PhonePe is notorious for. It would have been great if you could add an option to copy transaction details to clipboard.",
        "Google Pay has revolutionized the way the people manage their finances! From seamless transactions to earning rewards, this app has it all. The user-friendly interface makes sending and receiving money a breeze, and the security features provide peace of mind. Plus, the ability to pay bills and split expenses with friends simplifies my life. I highly recommend GPay to anyone looking for a convenient and reliable payment solution.",
        "It is always good! This app is fantastic and ideal for anyone trying to take quality photos. It produces crisp images and does a fantastic job capturing them. I'm giving it five stars since it merits praise for enabling this. There are no advertisements that might cause a disruption either. For those who are interested in themes, this program also contains lovely features. It is simple to use and has the potential to improve any app. People will find it to be of great use.",
        "Everything is fine. But, recently I got an issue like my transaction is failed due to network issue. And in the transaction history the status is failed. But my money got debited from the bank account and I didn't got any message like money got debited,but when I check my balance the money got debited. Then, I raised a ticket. They said the money will be credited within 3days. Now, they are asking for the bank statement after 3 days. I really don't like this feature. Please fix this.",
        "One of the most unreliable apps on the store. Has given me so much pain. Online transactions fail all the time. Money gets debited but transaction fails at the vendor end then I have to spend time running behind the bank (Google Pay doesn't take up any responsibility) and the vendor. Can't rely on it to pay for quick transactions like cab/auto fares because it fails at the most critical points and you are left scrambling. Planning to move completely to other UPI apps.",
        "I loved this app....!!!! In my experience of using the app for all kinds of payments and others, the performance is outstanding and smooth. The app layout and interface is very impressive. The cash back points for various payments is an added bonus. Kudos to the App team. However a small point to note for improvement. When the phone is on mobile data and not on wifi, a pop up appears frequently at the bottom saying \" No internet available\". So everytime it has to be clicked and removed....!",
        "Unique features are very interesting. The Fastest And Greatest App...But for the past month, it hasn't been functioning properly. I am able to use any barcode to scan and process payments. But my keyboard does not appear when I want to transfer money to someone via mobile. Not at all. Help, please; I've tried everything. I deleted the app's data and cache and even uninstalled and reloaded it. But, all in vain. Even after searching Google and YouTube, I still can't seem to grasp the issue.",
        "I like how easily the payments can be done in some cases. However most of the time when making bank payments, it shows trouble. Whenever you want to make a payment two in a row it stops. Also, the cashback and reward were good first but now they are not useful, relevant or good. The four offers you get after payment are all bad and not useful. Plus, they say to complete tasks for cashback and even if you do that, you won't get the offered cashback. So you can only use it for small payments.",
        "Since the last few days I've ran through some new issue which never occured before. I tried to reset my Pin and somehow it interfaces with a statement \"something went wrong with the bank servers\". Although this could be an issue with the Bank but I believe that if the developers take a deeper look into this app, then the issue could potentially be resolved. Hope you'll look forward into this.",
        "I have been a user of Google Pay for a considerable period, but recently, my experience has been less than satisfactory. For the past month, Google Pay has been consistently showing a 'Something went wrong' error during bank transactions. This issue is specific to Google Pay, as other payment apps work fine. Disappointing, considering its previous reliability.",
        "I keep getting \"Something went wrong\" error while trying to add my Visa credit card for tap and pay. The worst part is it won't even tell me exactly what went wrong. This is so stupid. Have a clear error message at least! I've tried updating the app, clearing the data and cache as well but nothing seems to work. This is a pathetic experience!!! Fix it asap.",
        "To view your card info you have to open up chrome and go to autofill. If you want to adjust payment settings you need to go the Google app instead. But if you want to tap-to-pay you use google wallet, but if you want to view your transactions you have to use this pointless app. Google took the concept of uncomplicated, convenient, and all in one place, and said \"let's do the polar opposite!\" Half of google searches are just people troubleshooting stupid issues that Google itself created",
        "If I could rate 10 stars I would. I can't say enough good things about Cash App! I use it for all my banking needs. I get paid 3 days early, I save money with roundups, my ATM fees are reimbursed and now I have $50 free overdraft protection! Love this app more than PayPal or Venmo. So easy to send and receive $. No waiting for verification or anything. And almost everyone is on cash app. Super easy to look people up whether or not they are on your contact list"
