        "First off I'm glad there's no crashes or anything like that although there are a little bit of audio issue's that's really it. I've been playing this game for a week and i had recently ranked up to expert rank, and let me just say there are A TON OF BOTS!!! while this is common in mobile games the A.I is so bad you will often see your teammates running into walls Losing you matches (each ranked match is 10 minutes) also there is a cap on gold meaning you can only get 2000 a week,terrible idea\ud83e\udd26",
        "I am having a lot of connection issues which I can't control and my screen freezes between battles too much. Not to mention I get penalized for something I have no control over. The app needs better servers and they should be able to fix these types of issues. The ranked matches are terrible like you don't even know who your opponents choose. The app doesn't do a good job in explaining everything well and doesn't mention penalty scores at all until you lost connection & suddenly you loose points",
        "Gameplay's fun. The art style and customization really cute, too. However, Unite throws tons of features at you and teaches them poorly, so it's easy to build your character wrong. Boost Emblems are one example: the auto-select feature is a trap. The UI is badly designed e.g. move upgrade choices shown overtop other moves' buttons, where a wrong press can cost you a match. Frustrating! The SBMM is utterly, reprehensibly broken, so good luck ever getting a winnable match past a certain point.",
        "Love this game. Play it all the time on the switch. BUT... They have to and I beg have to make the backbone compatible to enjoy it on the phone. When playing on the phone it's difficult hitting the buttons since I have bigger thicker hands. It also blocks my view, and actions are pushed accidentally or slip on movement. Please add backbone compatibility ASAP. I can't take my switch to work but can enjoy it on phone.",
        "I don't think I've ever had any real issue with this game. Its a fun, refreshing style of MOBA. Even with the worst connections my games been stable. No embedded ads, like most games it's pay to progress faster, but really you can go just as far with what you start with. The only things I could come up with as complaints is that I can't convince my friends to play it, and that teammates can be idiots at times, but thats got nothing to do with the game itself. Great game. 5/5",
        "Nintendo you've done it again! making yet another game that's worth playing for hours on end. I agree with a lot of people that the difficulty is very hard on this game but if you watch videos on how to play and set up your characters you'll be just fine. My only wish is that you add more maps for ranked matches and have them switch up at random so your not playing the same field over and over. ALSO! PLEASE NERF TALONFLAME he's too dang strong",
        "Great game! It feels entertaining and plus it keeps me happy after a nice days' work. I'll recommend others to atleast try the game. It's great for passing time. On the down side, most of times there are so many network issues in the game that you can't have a fair match instead they say that you'll have a fair match up. Plus there's a problem with the screen, sometimes the game doesn't load on full screen and it causes problems, kindly fix it.",
        "The game is fun, and every new Pok\u00e9mon added does spice up the experience. Whilst I am not a frequent player by any means (I played during the Mewtwo event, and the next time I came back was during the Miraidon event), but the game can be fun. The biggest problem is the fact that every single time I press the Begin Battle button on the lobby screen, it dims the screen for a solid 20 seconds where I can't interact with anything, which ends up giving me undeserved penalties. That needs a fix. Now.",
        "This short fast-paced game is a unique twist to the MOBA genre. Every character design, event, and match is never the same twice. There are limitless strategies, and unlimited possibilities for the outcome of each match. Some are difficult, these test your team synergy to the utmost. Incredible and unpredictable things happen in every match. Victory and defeat are important parts of the game, as they help players improve by replaying matches and evaluating tactics from the players that did well.",
        "As an avid player, I have encountered numerous instances where the matchmaking has led to frustrating experiences that detract from the overall enjoyment of the game.One of the primary issues I have encountered is the inconsistency in player skill levels within matches. It is disheartening to be matched with players who do not seem to understand the objectives of the game or prioritize team. Overall the game is very ENJOYABLE!! AND PLZ FIX THAT PROBLEM\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",
        "I like this game soo much! But there is a problem in it 1.fair play points and can't leave. Add leave button on setting beside surrender and when a player leave computer start playing. 2.In friendly match add that when we send messages computers have to follow. Example: If i say i need backup then one of them who is closer to me, he will come to help. Thank you",
        "Very good game, I like the fact you can play on your own or with others, the boost emblems are very interesting but with so many options you need to really build your collection before you can actually tailor a set it would be nice to be able to buy specific boost emblems for extra gold or aos tickets, for example this would add more ability for new players to make more specialised builds and have more free rein. Also the prize machine is quite hard for free players but the event balls were good",
        "It is good one. But if you make the downloading system more suitable way like players can download it whenever and only what they want. Not in the order that you say. You can make the downloading section like that ther will be sections called your favourite, owned items( holowear, fashion items extra), new event sections etc. like that will attract the game next level and players can get more comfortable with this game. I assume that you would look after it.",
        "Awesome game. Excellent gameplay. Excellent controls. (You can even use a key-map overlay with a wireless controller if your device supports it.) Awesome and big variety of pokemon. I like the fact that they highlight some pokemon people didn't even know about. It takes skill to play; so new players shouldn't be dismayed, but persevere. Three nice; five stars. Keep it up",
        "Great game amazing graphics, animations, gameplay BUT the ranked sysytem needs a major rework. Often times you get paired with teammates who should be way lower rabked than you so it often feels unfair. Bot games and the rank protection also make less good players climb up the ranks and drag good players down. Also the game doesn't really teach you how to use held items so that would also be good to add a tutorial.",
        "I gave this game a three because of ranked. When it comes to this I rage so hard because I'm getting beginner rank players meanwhile I'm in Great. I love it personally, but I'm thinking about deleting it. Also, the holowear and fashion items you have to download while you play which means that you don't have access to everything. Maybe instead of that, download everything when you download the app it self.",
        "Game is fun. However falls shy of the 4/5 star. 1. Lack of Controller Support on Mobile is very disappointing. Seems like a very easy fix that should have been added from the start. 2. Game was designed for children. Tutorial was lack luster. Started playing with my son who is 10 years old. After doing all the prerequisites I felt he still needed guidance.",
        "It's fun, My favorite part is that it's easy to obtain new pokemon, instead of spending a couple of years grinding. One issue I have, though, It feels like I'm playing with bots. Just by watching their movement, predicting what thier going to say, it feels like I'm playing with a bunch of bots. Maybe it's because I'm still in beginner rank. Otherwise I would reccomend.",
        "The game is fun but has a lot of design issues. Many times, teammates would leave the game in the middle. If you report teammates for leaving, you prevent losing rank points, but your pokemon's win rate can still go down. You need 2 people to surrender, even in case 3 teammates leave the game. The game is aweful with match making at higher levels (punishes you with bots for teammates). The MVP rating system is deeply flawed as it does favors individualistic plays. Written with no user analysis.",
        "Honestly, This game is awesome. It's so cool, I only downloaded it today and it is already feeling like a great game. I only played 3 total matches and 1 training and all was a success. There are different combinations for movesets and they only last for the match so if you don't like the combinations of the movesets you make, you can go into another match and use a different moveset."
