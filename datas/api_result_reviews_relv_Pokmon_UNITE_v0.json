Plus there's a problem with the screen, sometimes the game doesn't load on full screen and it causes problems, kindly fix it.",

Rank push is difficult unless u have ur own team of 5 players n u play with a strategy. There should be an option to kickout noobs from the team or leave the team when u see that someone is trying to ruin the match during pokemon selection.",

As a Pok\u00e9mon fan, I particularly enjoy playing it, especially when with friends. My friends and I started playing it upon its release, and we've continued to enjoy it. However, there's one thing I don't like about it, which is also a problem for many players: the time it takes to find a battle. Sometimes it takes over 2 minutes, which is really irritating.",

Matchmaking in ranked the players are too wide of rank levels in a single game, its worse having more skilled players paired with clueless players not knowing the fundementals of the game for the playerbase actually playing the game, impossible to have any form of fun when matchmaking gap is so far wide. Top game otherwise what a shame, would love to spend money but game is so ruined in balance tuning, i can't.",

Pretty sure yall know what I talking about. They'll let u win once and lose 7x or more. I've thrown my phone many times not a good game.
