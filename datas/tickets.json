Whenever you want to make a payment two in a row it stops. Also, the cashback and reward were good first but now they are not useful, relevant or good. The four offers you get after payment are all bad and not useful. Plus, they say to complete tasks for cashback and even if you do that, you won't get the offered cashback. So you can only use it for small payments.",
